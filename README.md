# TechDegree Capstone Project - Build Your Own Site

## Purpose:
* Utilize all of my JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and framework skills to build an entire site (front- and back-end) using a MERN stack.
## Note:
* This project was entirely created without any starter files from Treehouse. 
## To Use:
Download the project, then in your terminal, navigate to the directory and use `npm install` to download all dependencies.
**Note:** You will need to install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

Once installed, run `npm start` in your terminal to start a development server. 
In separate terminal, go into the client folder and run `npm start` to set up the React server.

Alternatively, you can set your Node environment to production and only run `npm start` from the root directory.


Final project is [here](https://postcard-app.herokuapp.com/). Enjoy!
